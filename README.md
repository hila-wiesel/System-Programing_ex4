# System-Programing_ex4

In this task we were asked to create a struct TRIE, a type of tree, for storing words and saving the frequency for each word.
The program includes reading input from the user a string of words separated by a space, tab or new line. Inserting these words into the TRIE according to the appropriate character, and printing each word next to its frequency in a lexicographical order ascends, or descends (depending on user choice).
After printing the words, the space allocated for each vertex in the tree is released, including the entire program.
